# QUB PgCert Games Technologies - Prototype 2
Completed as part of the QUB PgCert Games Technologies course.
This is the result of completing the Unity tutorial section 2.4 for the Junior programmer pathway.

## Overview
This project is a simple top down game prototype developed using Unity. The player controls a character that can move left and right. Pressing the space key makes the character emit a food projectile that will "feed" the oncoming stampede of animals. If any animals get past the player without being fed, game over!
